# cloud-regime-error-metric
This is a set of metrics based on RMS error which indicate the overall performance of a model to simulate the cloud radiative effects (CREs) of cloud regimes in annual mean climatology. The cloud regimes are defined as grid-boxes sharing similar daily mean cloud top pressures, optical depths and cloud covers from the ISCCP data. It is documented in Williams and Webb 2009 (for CFMIP1) and Tsushima et al., 2013 (for CMIP5).
